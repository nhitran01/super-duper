Project Background
Short Time Stock Price Prediction research project aims to predict the short-term price (next 1-hour) of two major Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which are S&P 500 (SPY) and NASDAQ 100 (QQQ). Our client company is Jane Street Capital - a financial consulting firm focusing on technology and collaborative problem-solving. In this report, we provide the analytic model of a sequence such as timer-series and text data using deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformers.
